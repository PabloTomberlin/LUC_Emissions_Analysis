# LUC_Emissions_Analysis

Pablo Tomberlin SULI project, summer 2025

Using data from the Global Carbon Project, several LUC time series
are run through Hector to determine the how different understandings
of past emissions affect uncertainty in projections.

This repository contains all code and data needed to reproduce my results.

If you want to run this code yourself, open the `final_analysis_script.R`
